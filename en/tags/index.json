[{"content":"Intro I bought my first 3D printer. Yes, I finally did it. I have chosen an Artillery Sidewinder X2. The following article tells you, why i think it\u0026rsquo;s a big deal.\nPros and Cons Because in my opinion the Artillery Sidewinder X2 is a really smart choice at the time of writing if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend exorbitary money and have some wishes like a 300x300x400mm printable volume, an direct extruder, auto bed leveling, an included color-touch-display and a filament sensor. On top, its a really silent printer and the heat-bed is not only ultra fast heated up, the 110/220V heat-bed voltage needs no big power supply and so the installed small one needs only a semi-passiv silent fan. Great selection.\n","description":"Talking about my new hobby","id":0,"section":"maker","tags":null,"title":"Artillery Sidewinder X2 3D FDM Printer","uri":"https://blog.freakydu.de/en/maker/2022-05-17-artillery_sidewinder_x2/"},{"content":"Motivation Are you one of the nerds, who likes to develop your own game, fancy graphics or any aspect that comes with that or would you do your first steps with the young programming language Rust, which unites speed of C/C++ with memory- and thread-safety?\nWhy not combining both aspects to have some fun learning new things?\nEnvironment Just to be even more nerdy, I show you a way to do that all within the Windows Subsystem for Linux and it\u0026rsquo;s brand new graphical extension under Windows 11.

If you ever worked with a package manager for Linux (e.g. apt, pacman) you know the benefits. Or, if you are a developer, you surely heard about nuget, maven, npm or similar. Easy install, uninstall or update of one or up to all installed applications on your system.\nNow you will say, that\u0026rsquo;s a old hat, it already exists Chocolatey. You are right - and at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s even more advanced.\nAnyways, WinGet is official supported and developed by guidance of Microsoft and will be integrated in future Windows releases. So, for me that\u0026rsquo;s the way to go.\nInstallation Prerequisites The client requires Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) or later at this time.\nAutomatic by MS-Store The client is distributed within the App Installer package. While this package is pre-installed on Windows, the client will not be made generally available during the Preview period.\nManual install Until the Preview period is over, the straightforward way ist to install it - yes - manually. You get the same package here. Download and execute the Microsoft.DesptopAppInstaller_xxx.appxbundle. See the official Readme.md for more information.\nRecommendations After installation open the windows command line (cmd.exe) or a powershell.\n If you start it as an administrator, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to accept the elevation dialogs later on.\n Before you install your applications, I recommend to modify some settings first.\nPermanent Settings Customize some basic settings before you first install or upgrade applications with WinGet.\nEdit the settings file by with executing\n1  winget settings   In the opened settings.json file, setup your preferred language priority list (e.g. to German) and your installation scope to machine (instead of user local)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  { \u0026#34;installBehavior\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;preferences\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;locale\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;de-DE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en-US\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;machine\u0026#34; } } }   A complete list of settings can be found here\nUsage As an example, let us search for PeaZip, a nice open source compress and decompress application for the most compress algorithms out there.\nJust run the following command.\n1  winget search PeaZip   If you are unsure if the result is the application you searched for, you can run the winget show command with one of the found application IDs.\n1  winget show Giorgiotani.Peazip   You should get more information about the package to be installed.\nIf you got the right package, install the found Giorgiotani.Peazip package.\n1  winget install PeaZip -h   The parameter -h is used to hide the installer assistent and just install the application silently to the program files folder. If you used the scope local in the settings preferences above, then the installed application is placed in your user accounts AppData folder.\nTo upgrade an installed application to the latest version, run the upgrade option. As always, if unsure about the application name, use its ID instead.\n1  winget upgrade PeaZip -h   And finally one of my favorites, like the Linux command apt-get upgrade you can just run\n1  winget upgrade --all -h   To update all installed applications which can be found in the repository to their latest version. Because we also set the -h parameter, it\u0026rsquo;s done silently again.\nFinal words Here it is, a native package manager for Windows applications. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s version 1.0 and you can\u0026rsquo;t expect that you found your lovely package or get a fancy UI. But, for found applications, the repeated sessions to search, download and update are gone. Just run an upgrade --all from time to time (or automate it) and your are done.\nThis tool, saves you a lot of time.\nHave fun.\n","description":"A short intro to the finally released WinGet 1.0.

But let me begin with some pros and cons about the Arch Linux distribution here.\nThe Arch Linux distribution describes itself as \u0026ldquo;a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple\u0026rdquo;\nThats it - Arch Linux is absolutely the right distribution for you, if you like a system, what only does, what you have installed and configured. It does it only that way, no magic happens. In addition it has a great community with a up-to-date wiki about nearly all aspects of the system. So if you have to configure a package, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly enough to follow the associated article there.\nWidely used distributions There is no need to dive in as deep as you have to with Slackware or Gentoo. For example, normally you don\u0026rsquo;t have to compile anything, but you have the freedom to do it anyways. Both are like Arch Linux a rolling releases. That means, you can have always the latest stable version of the kernel and all software packages, mostly on the same day of their release. Big pro for update junkies and you never have to do a big upgrade after a half year of waiting.\nOn the other hand, there are Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. They are working out of the box. They have a graphical installer, pre-configured packages and including proprietary drivers for e.g. graphic cards. Most Debian based distribution are not rolling released. They have big releases from time to time and you can choose to upgrade or stay with your release for a while. Updates are mostly security fixes only. If you a beginner or just want to use a good looking Linux, without have to worry about internals - choose them.\nRound-up In my opinion, Arch Linux catches the sweet spot. Without spending most of the time in configuring details, you get an always up-to-date, slim distribution. And while working with it, you have the chance to learn a lot about how the linux-ecosystem works.\nIn future posts, I will help you with some aspects here.\n","description":"About pros and cons using Arch Linux","id":5,"section":"developer","tags":null,"title":"Why do I prefer Arch Linux?","uri":"https://blog.freakydu.de/en/developer/2021-04-22-why_arch_linux/"},{"content":"Information according to § 5 TMG Frank Roth\nBadstr. 40a\n90762 Fuerth\nGermany\nContact Phone: 004915205448415\nE-mail: developer@freakydu.de\nEditorially responsible Frank Roth\nBadstr. 40a\n90762 Fuerth\nE-Mail: developer@freakydu.de\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"about","tags":null,"title":"Imprint","uri":"https://blog.freakydu.de/en/about/imprint/"},{"content":"Personal data (usually referred to just as \"data\" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.\nPer Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the \"GDPR\"), \"processing\" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.\nThe following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others.
