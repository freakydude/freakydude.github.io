After reading a lot of discussions I understood the relationships between the printer mainboard, the included TFT, Marlin and Klipper and got an idea.\nSo I started an experiment which I think was successful. It resulted in an open source project, which in itself is an experiment.\nSooo what am I talking about?! I made the integrated display (and potentially any supported BigTreeTech TFT) work with Klipper.\nCaution First of all, and as always with my other posts and projects. I am not a company. I’m doing this in my spare time and mostly because I’m really excited to make these things work and improve things.\nI tested all this stuff only with my own printer and the constellation around it. I did my best to make it all work without problems. However There is no warranty. Be careful, watch your printer, double check things. Use it as it is. I assume no liability for damages or consequences of any kind.\nPrerequisites A Raspberry PI or Bigtreetech CB1 (as mostly already in use for Klipper) A Level Shifter (cheap part, for example) A BigTreeTech TFT in touch mode (I used it with Artillery Sidewinder X2, BTT TFT28 with GD32F305 chipset) Most things should work with official artillery firmware To get all the features, flash their open source TouchScreenFirmware Not merged yet, but there is a version for your GD32F305 TFT controller version. See this issue until it’s mainline. Thanks for all the work guys!! So, let’s start hacking and improving your printer.\nWiring First, you need to wire things up. Disconnect the display from your mainboard. It needs to be connected to your Raspberry Pi instead.\nI made a little schematic where you connect your PI with a level shifter to the UART (serial) interface of your BTT TFT (or compatible like the one in our Artillery Sidewinder X2). It’s really important to use a level shifter here. If your RPi GPIO UART pins get 5V they will be irreparably damaged, burned. Be careful!\nThat’s not a mistake. Make sure that somewhere between the display UART and the RPi UART you have a TX (transmit) and RX (receive) crossover to allow a bidirectional connection between them.\nThat is all the hardware magic you need.\nNow for the more interesting part, the software\nSoftware The hardware wiring is only part of the story. The following schematic shows the relevant components, their connection and the type of data transferred. I hope it helps to understand the concept and the connections.\nYou can find my project at https://github.com/freakydude/klipper-serial-btt\nSet up Serial software bridge with systemd service Start preparing your RaspberryPi or BigTreeTech CB1 (or similar) as described here\nSet up Klipper (with Mainsail) As you can see in the schematic above, your touchscreen and the BigTreeTech firmware running on it are based on g-codes. So basically it sends and receives Marlin compatible g-codes upon interaction.Therefore, in order for Klipper to communicate with the display in a useful way, we need to provide the necessary gcode macros for Klipper.\nStart preparing your Klipper/Mainsail configs as described here\nTo keep the overview, I have split the macros into 4 files (at the time of writing).\nfd-macros-example.cfg For full Mainsail feature support, it is a must to add some macros. They even have a self-updating repository of what you can add to your Klipper/Mainsail configuration. To enable some functions on your TFT, some of these functions need to be changed. But, due to technical limitations, I don’t know a way how to override gcode commands twice (that’s what we would have to do).\nThis fact has consequences:\nAt the moment I don’t know a way to extend/replace their macros, but I need to. So I reimplemented the needed functionality. This makes me kind of sad. It also means you can’t use their config files/project, they conflict with my scripts. I made this file, if you look at it, it mostly just calls “internal” macros, starting with _FD_. So I’m trying to give you the ability to “override” my individual scripts with whatever you want and hopefully not get into conflicts. So if you have an Artillery Sidewinder X2 and just want to get started, use this file as it is and feel freakyDude’s printing style ;-).\nIf you need or want to have your own scripts, don’t include this file. But copy it completely, include your copy, still call the internal functions and adapt it to your needs. Its kind of a front for the other macros.\nfd-macros/klipper-modules.cfg This file activates all the modules needed to support all the features required by both Mainsail and BTT TouchScreen. If you have already configured some of the modules, you can delete them from your other config files.\nfd-macros/mainsail-support.cfg This file contains all the “internal” macros to support the current Mainsail features required by both Mainsail and BTT Touchscreen. I would not suggest replacing them. Use them as they are.\nIf there are problems with it, let’s discuss the issue and create a pull request.\nfd-macros/bigtreetech-support.cfg Similar to mainsail-support.cfg this file contains all the “internal” macros to support the current BTT touchscreen features. Mostly this is a subset of the Marlin g-codes. It also sends some information to the display. I only implemented what I needed and tested the features. Some things don’t fit between Klipper and Marlin. I think it’s a good start. So it communicates in both directions.\nAs with the script above, use them as they are. If there are problems with it, let’s discuss the issue and create a pull request.\nSet up your slicer To enable the progress and color change features, configure your slicer as described here\nConclusion If you have successfully followed my instructions, you may be one of the first people on the planet to have this combination, a BTT touchscreen in Marlin touch mode, working on a Klipper firmware-driven printer. And yes, since we are all green these days, you did not throw away your working hardware.
