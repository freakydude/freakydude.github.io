Klipper has the powerful possibility to add G-Code macros or even overwrite existing G-Codes. By default, Klipper knows only about standard G-Codes ([Described in Klipper documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html)). You have to configure everything that goes beyond. Scenarios are filament runout, pause and resume print, filament change, cancel objects etc. In case of the Artillery Sidewinder X2, you can also add some macros what should happen with the Neopixel LED on your extruder.

The basic idea is often not mine. Instead, I have gathered examples from documentation and adapted them to the Sidewinder X2 and my needs. My advice is that you also start this way. But you can also just copy mine for your first steps with your Sidewinder.

## Basic mainsail setup

For the basic setup of Klipper with Mainsail, you should start to configure your machine. Setup the printer, mainsail and add some basic must have macros.

1. Login to your Mainsail webpage on your RaspberryPI or where ever you run it.
1. Navigate to
   ![edit mainsail and klipper config files screenshot](images/mainsail_configfiles.png "edit mainsail and klipper config files")
1. I suggest to split your configuration in files according to their content. First add/edit the following 3 config files.
   1. The [printer.cfg](printer.cfg) contains all configuration about your Sidewinder X2 printer hardware. It also includes a reference the next two config files.
   1. The [macros.cfg](macros.cfg) that contains basic g-code macros for start, end, pause, resume and cancel the print. In my case there also some helper scripts for example to enable the extruder LED.
   1. And lastly the [mainsail.cfg](mainsail.cfg). It configures the basic features in combination with the used Mainsail UI. For example to enable the virtual sd-card, exclude objects or pause and resume prints.

### Printer.cfg

The [printer.cfg](printer.cfg) file represents the printer hardware. In this case the stock Artillery Sidewinder X2, sold in 2022. I already introduced the [printer.cfg](printer.cfg) in my last [blog post](../2022-10-01-klipper_with_artillery_sidewinder_x2/).
Meanwhile I created a merge request to the official klipper repository. So it will be only a matter of some days, that they include my config into the official Klipper repository as an example printer configuration.

**Update** The basic printer.cfg example for Artillery Sidewinder X2 is merged into official Klipper3d repository. Find it [here](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/config/printer-artillery-sidewinder-x2-2022.cfg)

In one of my next posts, I will show you how we can add ADXL345 support to enable the automatic an precise calibration of the [resonance compensation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html).

See more about the configuration of your hardware in the excellent Klipper [configuration reference](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html).

Don't forget to **calibrate at least your `z_offset`** carefully before printing. If not, you could damage your printer heatbed. See [bed leveling](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html) for more instructions.

### Mainsail.cfg

The [mainsail.cfg](mainsail.cfg) file represents the minimum configuration for Mainsail. And it is at this point basically the result of [Mainsail required configuration page](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/configuration).

In contrast to their guide, we moved the g_code macros to an additional [macros.cfg](macros.cfg) file.

### Macros.cfg

The [macros.cfg](macros.cfg) file contains all our basic g-code macros. That includes the START_PRINT, END_PRINT, PRIME_LINE, PRESENT_PRINT, PAUSE, RESUME and CANCEL_PRINT macro. In Addition I added some very basic macros to enable/set/disable the led under the extruder (ELED_ON, SET_ELED and ELED_OFF).

### Finally

If you done everything right, Mainsail does not show errors or warnings on it's dashboard. Mainsail is ready to print.

But before printing, make sure that you read the following [section](#basic-slicer-setup-cura).

## Basic slicer setup (Cura)

I will show you on the example of the [Ultimaker Cura slicer](https://ultimaker.com/de/software/ultimaker-cura) how to setup your Sidewinder X2 - especially the start g-code and end g-code. Of course you can adapt this to the other great slicers out there.

If you used Marlin before, you don't have to change the printer and printhead settings. If not, the easiest way for an initial configuration is to add the an Artillery Sidewinder X1 as your printer and rename it to X2. It has the same settings.

Whats new with Klipper? As you can configure your own g-code macros in Klipper, it's a good practice to replace the default Cura Start G-code and End G-code scripts by your own G-code macros.
If you use my [macros.cfg](macros.cfg) above, all the start and end logic is defined there.

![cura machine settings sceenshot](images/cura_machine_settings.png "cura machine settings sceenshot")

Just call the [START_PRINT](#start-g-code) and the [END_PRINT](#end-g-code) G-code macros in your Cura machine settings Start-G-code and End-G-Code sections as seen in the screenshot above.

For copy and paste:

### Start G-code

```text
START_PRINT BED_TEMP={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} EXTRUDER_TEMP={material_print_temperature_layer_0}
```

It calls the 'START_PRINT' macro from [macros.cfg](macros.cfg) with the in Cura configured material print temperatures.

### End G-code

```text
END_PRINT
```

It calls the 'END_PRINT' macro from [macros.cfg](macros.cfg).

## Conclusion

If you followed the steps, make sure, you calibrated your z_offset and your bed mesh. And you are ready to print your first object with Klipper.

For further steps and more details it is always a very good idea to walk through the very good official documentations

- [Klipper Documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html)
- [Mainsail Documentation](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/)
- [Moonraker Documentation](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/)

If you also like to reenable the stock filament runout sensor a new post about that is online: [Reenable and configure the filament-runout sensor with Klipper](../2022-12-23-reenable_sidewinder_x2_runout_sensor/)

Please leave a comment if there is something wrong or missing. Or if you have any questions.
Have fun!
