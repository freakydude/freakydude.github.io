## Intro

One of the common frustrations among 3D printing enthusiasts is the inaccuracy of print time estimations provided by slicing software and firmware. This can lead to unexpected delays and scheduling issues. Fortunately, with Klipper firmware, you can significantly improve the accuracy of print time estimations by using the Klipper Estimator plugin along with proper configuration in Moonraker, Mainsail, and KlipperScreen.

## Configure Klipper Estimator in Moonraker

1. First, you need to enable the Klipper Estimator plugin in Moonraker. This plugin analyzes your G-code files and provides more accurate print time estimations based on various factors such as print speed, acceleration, and jerk settings.

   To enable the plugin, add the following section to your `moonraker.conf` file:

   ```ini
   [analysis]
   auto_dump_default_config: true
   enable_auto_analysis: true
   enable_estimator_updates: true
   ```

2. Next you must configure Mainsail to use slicer estimations where possibe.
   Go to Mainsail > Settings:

   - Print progress calculation -> "Slicer (M73)"
   - ETA calculation method -> "Slicer"
   - Estimate time calculation -> "File, Filament"

3. Setup KlipperScreen to show the estimated time.
   Go to `KlipperScreen.conf`
   Add to main section

   ```ini
   [main]
   print_estimate_method = slicer
   ```

   or use the UI to set it.

4. Restart Moonraker and KlipperScreen to apply the changes.

## Conclusion

With these simple steps, you can significantly improve the print time estimation in Klipper. The klipper estimator plugin takes into account various factors such as print speed, acceleration, and jerk settings to provide a more accurate estimate. This will help you better plan your printing schedule and reduce frustration caused by inaccurate estimates.

Happy printing!
