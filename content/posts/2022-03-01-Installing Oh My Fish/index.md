About installing fish, a very helpful modern bash alternative in WSL2/Ubuntu. Enjoy the benefits of the powerline and nice helpers and visualizations in your common workflows.

## Install Fish

1. Install fish
   `sudo apt install fish`
1. Switch to fish
   `fish`
1. Set fish as default shell
   `chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`

_Hint_: Switch back to bash with `chsh -s /usr/bin/bash`

## Install 'Oh My Fish' with the theme 'Bob The Fish'

1. Install Oh My Fish
   `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/master/bin/install | fish`

1. Install Theme: Bob the Fish
   `omf install bobthefish`

## Install powerline fonts

1. Install Powerline fonts (Ubuntu/Debian/Mint Linux)
   `sudo apt-get update`
   `sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline`

## Fix fonts using WSL or Remote

The powerline and theme of oh my fish / bob the fish will not be shown correctly. Instead fancy symbols are shown.

Make sure that your console / terminal application like Windows Terminal or Visual Studio Code are using a font with is patched with powerline symbols.

Under windows, a good suggestion is to use MS font Cascadia in its variant **Cascadia (Code|Mono) PL**. You can find it at [Cascadia Code on Github](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).
