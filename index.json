If you have done the same, you may be experiencing the same problem as me. I have already received questions from you about how much better the printing results are with Klipper, but that is another topic.\nOur integrated display is useless!\nBut I found a solution - well - not perfect yet, but more than OK for my main use cases. After reading a lot of discussions I understood the relationships between the printer mainboard, the included TFT, Marlin and Klipper and got an idea.\nSo I started an experiment which I think was successful. It resulted in an open source project, which in itself is an experiment.\nSooo what am I talking about?! I made the integrated display (and potentially any supported BigTreeTech TFT) work with Klipper.\nCaution First of all, and as always with my other posts and projects. I am not a company. I\u0026rsquo;m doing this in my spare time and mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to make these things work and improve things.\nI tested all this stuff only with my own printer and the constellation around it. I did my best to make it all work without problems. However There is no warranty. Be careful, watch your printer, double check things. Use it as it is. I assume no liability for damages or consequences of any kind.\nPrerequisites A Raspberry PI or Bigtreetech CB1 (as mostly already in use for Klipper) A Level Shifter (cheap part, for example) A BigTreeTech TFT in touch mode (I used it with Artillery Sidewinder X2, BTT TFT28 with GD32F305 chipset) Most things should work with official artillery firmware To get all the features, flash their open source TouchScreenFirmware Not merged yet, but there is a version for your GD32F305 TFT controller version. See this issue until it\u0026rsquo;s mainline. Thanks for all the work guys!! So, let\u0026rsquo;s start hacking and improving your printer.\nWiring First, you need to wire things up. Disconnect the display from your mainboard. It needs to be connected to your Raspberry Pi instead.\nI made a little schematic where you connect your PI with a level shifter to the UART (serial) interface of your BTT TFT (or compatible like the one in our Artillery Sidewinder X2). It\u0026rsquo;s really important to use a level shifter here. If your RPi GPIO UART pins get 5V they will be irreparably damaged, burned. Be careful!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not a mistake. Make sure that somewhere between the display UART and the RPi UART you have a TX (transmit) and RX (receive) crossover to allow a bidirectional connection between them.\nThat is all the hardware magic you need.\nNow for the more interesting part, the software\nSoftware The hardware wiring is only part of the story. The following schematic shows the relevant components, their connection and the type of data transferred. I hope it helps to understand the concept and the connections.\nYou can find my project at https://github.com/freakydude/klipper-serial-btt\nSet up Serial software bridge with systemd service Start preparing your RaspberryPi or BigTreeTech CB1 (or similar) as described here\nSet up Klipper (with Mainsail) As you can see in the schematic above, your touchscreen and the BigTreeTech firmware running on it are based on g-codes. So basically it sends and receives Marlin compatible g-codes upon interaction.Therefore, in order for Klipper to communicate with the display in a useful way, we need to provide the necessary gcode macros for Klipper.\nStart preparing your Klipper/Mainsail configs as described here\nTo keep the overview, I have split the macros into 4 files (at the time of writing).\nfd-macros-example.cfg For full Mainsail feature support, it is a must to add some macros. They even have a self-updating repository of what you can add to your Klipper/Mainsail configuration. To enable some functions on your TFT, some of these functions need to be changed. But, due to technical limitations, I don\u0026rsquo;t know a way how to override gcode commands twice (that\u0026rsquo;s what we would have to do).\nThis fact has consequences:\nAt the moment I don\u0026rsquo;t know a way to extend/replace their macros, but I need to. So I reimplemented the needed functionality. This makes me kind of sad. It also means you can\u0026rsquo;t use their config files/project, they conflict with my scripts. I made this file, if you look at it, it mostly just calls \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; macros, starting with _FD_. So I\u0026rsquo;m trying to give you the ability to \u0026ldquo;override\u0026rdquo; my individual scripts with whatever you want and hopefully not get into conflicts. So if you have an Artillery Sidewinder X2 and just want to get started, use this file as it is and feel freakyDude\u0026rsquo;s printing style ;-).\nIf you need or want to have your own scripts, don\u0026rsquo;t include this file. But copy it completely, include your copy, still call the internal functions and adapt it to your needs. Its kind of a front for the other macros.\nfd-macros/klipper-modules.cfg This file activates all the modules needed to support all the features required by both Mainsail and BTT TouchScreen. If you have already configured some of the modules, you can delete them from your other config files.\nfd-macros/mainsail-support.cfg This file contains all the \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; macros to support the current Mainsail features required by both Mainsail and BTT Touchscreen. I would not suggest replacing them. Use them as they are.\nIf there are problems with it, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss the issue and create a pull request.\nfd-macros/bigtreetech-support.cfg Similar to mainsail-support.cfg this file contains all the \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; macros to support the current BTT touchscreen features. Mostly this is a subset of the Marlin g-codes. It also sends some information to the display. I only implemented what I needed and tested the features. Some things don\u0026rsquo;t fit between Klipper and Marlin. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good start. So it communicates in both directions.\nAs with the script above, use them as they are. If there are problems with it, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss the issue and create a pull request.\nSet up your slicer To enable the progress and color change features, configure your slicer as described here\nConclusion If you have successfully followed my instructions, you may be one of the first people on the planet to have this combination, a BTT touchscreen in Marlin touch mode, working on a Klipper firmware-driven printer. And yes, since we are all green these days, you did not throw away your working hardware.

It increases the max possible printer speed without reducing the print quality. More details can be found in Klipper Resonance Compensation documentation.\nThis article focuses on Klipper firmware, but also Marlin added Input Shaping as experimental feature in its latest Version. see M593.\nThere is also a manual way to determine the resonance frequencies but this post shows you the steps to measure the frequencies by an ADXL345 accelerometer chip. You can get it for some bucks.\nReady? Let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nRequirements What do you need?\nYour printer (tested with Artillery Sidewinder X2) A working Klipper installation (tested with MainsailOS) Jumper cables or similar ADXL345 accelerometer module Adapter to mount it on your extruder see my Design Raspberry Pi (or any other connected MCU with SPI interface) Install and wire the accelerometer As always, Klipper has a very clean and useful documentation. It describes well how to wire the accelerometer.\nA example how to connect your ADXL345 to the SPI interface of the RaspberryPI. Here is a copy of the relevant wiring diagram:\nI used standard jumper cables for that task, but in case you want to do some crafting, go on.\nIf you have the Sidewinder X1/X2 or Genius Pro you can use my mount from Thingiverse to install the accelerometer on your extruder. I suggest V2, the sensor is in parallel to the xy-plane and mounted with screws. Because those are bed slingers, the measurement of the resonance frequency should be split. For measure the frequency for y-axis, you should install the accelerometer on your heater bed. I made an adapter for that too. (Thanks to Paradisebaker to clarify that.)\nIf you own another printer, you have to look for different mounting solution.\nBuild a Klipper MCU for PI To make use of the SPI interface, you need to build and setup a additional Klipper firmware for your target. So you can configure it as an MCU in your config files.\nSoftware installation Detailed Klipper documentation\nLogin to your MainsailOS PI\nMake sure, needed packages are installed. (In newer MainsailOS everything is already installed)\nsudo apt update sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib libatlas-base-dev ~/klippy-env/bin/pip install -v numpy Build secondary MCU for PI RPi Micro-Controller documentation\nFirst, make sure the Linux SPI driver is enabled by running sudo raspi-config and enabling SPI under the \u0026ldquo;Interfacing options\u0026rdquo; menu.\nNext, compile the Klipper micro-controller code, start by configuring it for the \u0026ldquo;Linux process\u0026rdquo;:\ncd ~/klipper/ make menuconfig In the menu, set \u0026ldquo;Microcontroller Architecture\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Linux process,\u0026rdquo; then save and exit.\nBuild and install the new micro-controller code, run:\nsudo service klipper stop make flash sudo service klipper start Copy a the matching klipper-mcu service, enable and start it.\ncd ~/klipper/ sudo cp ./scripts/klipper-mcu.service /etc/systemd/system/ sudo systemctl enable --now klipper-mcu.service Configure the new compiled RPi MCU in your printer.cfg\n[mcu rpi] serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu [adxl345] cs_pin: rpi:None axes_map: -y, x, z # Depends on mounting direction.

This is the reason why neither the Marlin firmware nor Klipper recognized it by default. For both firmware you have to connect the sensor to the Artillery Ruby mainboard instead of the TFT controller board.\nThere are some minor problems to solve:\nDifferent voltage (3.3V vs 5V) Connect wires to free usable pins Configure Klipper Different voltage The pins of the artillery ruby mainboard have either 5V or 24V. But the filament runout-sensor is connected to the TFT controller at a 3.3V pin.\nSadly no specs about the runout-sensor are in circulation. So nobody knows, if 5V would be to much for it. But after some investigation, all similar sensors have a voltage range of 3~5V. So I tried it and it worked. But of course it\u0026rsquo;s your own decision and risk.\nConnect wires Caution Do it only if you feel experienced enough. Be aware that you do it at your own risk and that you will probably lose the Artillery\u0026rsquo;s warranty. I am not responsible for damages of any kind.\nI see two possibilities how to connect the filament-runout sensor wires to the correct pins. The fast version is without open the printer case. A beautiful solution is on the other hand to open the printer case.\nThe fast and dirty option Build yourself a adapter from a male JST-XH 2.54mm connector with 3 pins to your z-endstop JST SM connector with 3 pins. The z-endstop plug is fixed on the right side by an adhesive tape.\nYou need the two connector types:\nJST XH 2.54 connector JST SM connector Or you solve it just with some jumper cables. The pins from the filament runout sensors are If your filament runout sensor state LED is lit, your connection should be fine.\nThe beautiful option The more beautiful option is to do nothing on the outside of your Sidewinder X2. Instead open your printer case at the bottom. (As with any other modification, know what you are doing and be aware that your warranty will be lost).\nThere is the original cable coming from the small z-axis board and goes to the TFT-Controller board. You have to unplug it from the TFT-Controller board and plug it into the z-endstop connector of your Artillery Ruby board. Fix it with hot glue.\nThere is still one problem. The original cable was in my case not long enough. So I had to extend it. I did it by using my adapter cable from the fast and dirty version above. Instead, it would be better to replace the original cable with a cable that is long enough.\nFinally it\u0026rsquo;s time to configure Klipper.\nConfigure Klipper At the end you have to configure Klipper to use the newly connected filament-runout sensor. Thats probably the easiest part.\nOpen your printer.cfg and add the following section\n[filament_switch_sensor filament] pause_on_runout: True # Starts the PAUSE g-code script if filament runs out runout_gcode: M117 Filament runout # Optional insert_gcode: M117 Filament insert # Optional switch_pin: PA0 # the z-endstop pin and restart the Klipper firmware afterwards.\nIf you did it right, you will see a new entry in your Miscellaneous Section in your Mainsail Web-UI. It will toggle if you insert/remove filament into your filament-runout sensor. Also, your status lit will switch red/green as before.\nConclusion By walk through this post, you not only reenabled your filament-runout sensor - you also enabled it the first time for real. Even if you are still using the Marlin firmware, you have the first time the possibility to configure it in your firmware. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know, why Artillery didn\u0026rsquo;t connect it just right out of the box. But now it works and maybe you had some fun to fix the sensors.\nPlease leave a comment if there is something wrong or missing. Or if you have any questions.

By default, Klipper knows only about standard G-Codes (Described in Klipper documentation). You have to configure everything that goes beyond. Scenarios are filament runout, pause and resume print, filament change, cancel objects etc. In case of the Artillery Sidewinder X2, you can also add some macros what should happen with the Neopixel LED on your extruder.\nThe basic idea is often not mine. Instead, I have gathered examples from documentation and adapted them to the Sidewinder X2 and my needs. My advice is that you also start this way. But you can also just copy mine for your first steps with your Sidewinder.\nBasic mainsail setup For the basic setup of Klipper with Mainsail, you should start to configure your machine. Setup the printer, mainsail and add some basic must have macros.\nLogin to your Mainsail webpage on your RaspberryPI or where ever you run it. Navigate to I suggest to split your configuration in files according to their content. First add/edit the following 3 config files. The printer.cfg contains all configuration about your Sidewinder X2 printer hardware. It also includes a reference the next two config files. The macros.cfg that contains basic g-code macros for start, end, pause, resume and cancel the print. In my case there also some helper scripts for example to enable the extruder LED. And lastly the mainsail.cfg. It configures the basic features in combination with the used Mainsail UI. For example to enable the virtual sd-card, exclude objects or pause and resume prints. Printer.cfg The printer.cfg file represents the printer hardware. In this case the stock Artillery Sidewinder X2, sold in 2022. I already introduced the printer.cfg in my last blog post. Meanwhile I created a merge request to the official klipper repository. So it will be only a matter of some days, that they include my config into the official Klipper repository as an example printer configuration.\nUpdate The basic printer.cfg example for Artillery Sidewinder X2 is merged into official Klipper3d repository. Find it here\nIn one of my next posts, I will show you how we can add ADXL345 support to enable the automatic an precise calibration of the resonance compensation.\nSee more about the configuration of your hardware in the excellent Klipper configuration reference.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to calibrate at least your z_offset carefully before printing. If not, you could damage your printer heatbed. See bed leveling for more instructions.\nMainsail.cfg The mainsail.cfg file represents the minimum configuration for Mainsail. And it is at this point basically the result of Mainsail required configuration page.\nIn contrast to their guide, we moved the g_code macros to an additional macros.cfg file.\nMacros.cfg The macros.cfg file contains all our basic g-code macros. That includes the START_PRINT, END_PRINT, PRIME_LINE, PRESENT_PRINT, PAUSE, RESUME and CANCEL_PRINT macro. In Addition I added some very basic macros to enable/set/disable the led under the extruder (ELED_ON, SET_ELED and ELED_OFF).\nFinally If you done everything right, Mainsail does not show errors or warnings on it\u0026rsquo;s dashboard. Mainsail is ready to print.\nBut before printing, make sure that you read the following section.\nBasic slicer setup (Cura) I will show you on the example of the Ultimaker Cura slicer how to setup your Sidewinder X2 - especially the start g-code and end g-code. Of course you can adapt this to the other great slicers out there.\nIf you used Marlin before, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to change the printer and printhead settings. If not, the easiest way for an initial configuration is to add the an Artillery Sidewinder X1 as your printer and rename it to X2. It has the same settings.\nWhats new with Klipper? As you can configure your own g-code macros in Klipper, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to replace the default Cura Start G-code and End G-code scripts by your own G-code macros. If you use my macros.cfg above, all the start and end logic is defined there.\nJust call the START_PRINT and the END_PRINT G-code macros in your Cura machine settings Start-G-code and End-G-Code sections as seen in the screenshot above.\nFor copy and paste:\nStart G-code START_PRINT BED_TEMP={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} EXTRUDER_TEMP={material_print_temperature_layer_0} It calls the \u0026lsquo;START_PRINT\u0026rsquo; macro from macros.cfg with the in Cura configured material print temperatures.\nEnd G-code END_PRINT It calls the \u0026lsquo;END_PRINT\u0026rsquo; macro from macros.cfg.\nConclusion If you followed the steps, make sure, you calibrated your z_offset and your bed mesh. And you are ready to print your first object with Klipper.\nFor further steps and more details it is always a very good idea to walk through the very good official documentations\nKlipper Documentation Mainsail Documentation Moonraker Documentation If you also like to reenable the stock filament runout sensor a new post about that is online: Reenable and configure the filament-runout sensor with Klipper\nPlease leave a comment if there is something wrong or missing.

This article shows you one easy way how you can replace Marlin by Klipper as an alternative Firmware on your Sidewinder X2. Be aware, that your installed touch display, usb and sd card slot is unusable with klipper, because the way they are work and connected is not compatible to klipper. On my printer, I decided to disconnect and replace them by dummy prints, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nCaution Do it only if you feel experienced enough. Be aware that you do it at your own risk and that you will probably lose the Artillery\u0026rsquo;s warranty. I am not responsible for damages of any kind.\nPreconditions An Artillery Sidewinder X2, unmodified hardware and with Artillery Ruby V1.2 mainboard A Raspberry PI (Zero W, 3B+, 4) or similar compatible boards with SD card, power supply, usb connection to your printer A working pc to flash the PI, and as a remote SSH console to it The will to open your printer (and potential loss of warranty) Some experience with Linux and bash console Install MainsailOS and build Klipper firmware Basic install and configure Mainsail\nFlash a SD card for your Raspberry with MainsailOS. It\u0026rsquo;s a prepared Raspberry PI OS Lite a modern software stack to control your printer. The frontend in this case is by default Mainsail. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to OctoPrint but more modern and to use with Klipper driven printers only. Follow the official MainsailOS installation guide. There is also simple article on All3DP. On the documentation page Klipper setup you need a basic printer.cfg that tells Klipper all about your connected printer hardware. In Marlin, this configurations are in Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h and have to be recompiled on any change. In Klipper, this is just a config file and one of the benefits is, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to recompile the whole firmware on changes. There are a lot of example configs the the klipper repository but not yet for the Artillery Sidewinder X2. But you have a lucky day. I created a printer.cfg for the Sidewinder X2. Download it here: printer.cfg. Meanwhile, my Klipper pull request got merged into the official Klipper examples. So the Sidewinder X2 example file is here. Flash klipper to your printer mainboard\nAs mentioned under caution - be sure, you know what you are doing. I never tried to switch back to Marlin. Normally, it should be no problem, but I never tried till the time of writing this (comments are welcome).\nYou have to bridge two pins, to enable the \u0026ldquo;flash mode\u0026rdquo; of your mainboard. Open your printer (screws on the bottom). Connect the pins BOOT0 and +3.3V with a jumper or a breadboard cable. (You have to remove it after flashing!). Connect your Raspberry PI via USB cable to your Artillery Sidewinder X2. Then power on your printer and your Raspberry. Connect to it by using SSH or connect keyboard and monitor to it. Login to console by default with user: pi, password: raspberry.\nBefore flash, you have to configure and build your firmware for your printer once. Open your PI console and type\ncd ~/klipper/ make menuconfig In the opened configuration-menu change only the following:\nSet Micro-controller Architecture to STMicroelectronics STM32 Set Processor model to STM32F401 Set Bootloader offset to No bootloader Quit (Q) and Save (Y) Build the firmware with\nmake Flash the build firmware with\nmake flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f401xc_4F006F000351383532393535-if00 In your case maybe the device has another id/path. Adapt the command in that case. As mentioned under caution - be sure, you know what you are doing.\nRead more details in official Klipper documentation: Building and flashing the micro-controller\nRemove the flash mode jumper you set above\nReboot your Raspberry, follow the mainsail and klipper configuration checks.\nFollow the Klipper config checks. Ignore OctoPrint, because your setup is with Mainsail instead. Especially make sure some values are adapted and calibrated for your individual printer Especially the z-offset And the extruder rotation_distance (Measure it without an installed Nozzle!) Calibrate PID values for heat-bed and extruder nozzle Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to setup/adapt your slicers begin-/end g-code Your done and ready to get in touch with Klipper and it\u0026rsquo;s endless possibilities. It takes a time to understand the context.\nPreview to future posts If I got some time, be excited about the topics\nA useful set of G-code macros (filament runout, pause resume, start-stop print).

Yes, I finally did it. After reading blogs, ratings and some youtube videos, I have chosen an Artillery Sidewinder X2. The following article tells you, why I think it was a good decision.\nPros and Cons At time of writing this post, the Artillery Sidewinder X2 is a really smart choice if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend exorbitant money. If you love some features like a 300x300x400mm printable volume, an direct extruder, auto bed leveling, an included color-touch-display and a filament sensor. On top, its a really silent printer and the heat-bed is not only ultra fast heated up, the 220/110V heat-bed voltage needs no big power supply and so the installed power supply one needs only a semi-passive silent fan.\nOn the downside, this heat-bed is in reality a bit problematic. Because the head-bed construction has a very uneven temperature distribution. I think, you just must be clear about that fact and adjust the temperature if needed.\nAlso, if you read through some other blogs and youtube channels, some guys complain about the BL Touch auto-bed-leveling sensor clone, installed on the Sidewinder. I personally can\u0026rsquo;t complain about it, but I have to say, I did\u0026rsquo;t work with an BLtouch sensor yet.\nPositive Negative Medium printing volume (300x300x400mm) Direct extruder Auto Bed-Leveling No original BL-Touch, a Artillery clone with good precision Color-Touch-Display Ultra fast 220/110V coated glass heat-bed Heat-Bed uneven temperature distribution Silent printing, drives, power-supply Conclusion That\u0026rsquo;s a great package for this money from Artillery.

Easy install, uninstall or update of one or up to all installed applications on your system.\nNow you will say, that\u0026rsquo;s a old hat, it already exists Chocolatey. You are right - and at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s even more advanced.\nAnyways, WinGet is official supported and developed by guidance of Microsoft and will be integrated in future Windows releases. So, for me that\u0026rsquo;s the way to go.\nInstallation Prerequisites The client requires Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) or later at this time.\nAutomatic by MS-Store The client is distributed within the App Installer package. While this package is pre-installed on Windows, the client will not be made generally available during the Preview period.\nManual install Until the Preview period is over, the straightforward way ist to install it - yes - manually. You get the same package here. Download and execute the Microsoft.DesptopAppInstaller_xxx.appxbundle. See the official Readme.md for more information.\nRecommendations After installation open the windows command line (cmd.exe) or a powershell.\nIf you start it as an administrator, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to accept the elevation dialogs later on.\nBefore you install your applications, I recommend to modify some settings first.\nPermanent Settings Customize some basic settings before you first install or upgrade applications with WinGet.\nEdit the settings file by with executing\nwinget settings In the opened settings.json file, setup your preferred language priority list (e.g. to German) and your installation scope to machine (instead of user local)\n{ \u0026#34;installBehavior\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;preferences\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;locale\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;de-DE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en-US\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;machine\u0026#34; } } } A complete list of settings can be found here\nUsage As an example, let us search for PeaZip, a nice open source compress and decompress application for the most compress algorithms out there.\nJust run the following command.\nwinget search PeaZip If you are unsure if the result is the application you searched for, you can run the winget show command with one of the found application IDs.\nwinget show Giorgiotani.Peazip You should get more information about the package to be installed.\nIf you got the right package, install the found Giorgiotani.Peazip package.\nwinget install PeaZip -h The parameter -h is used to hide the installer assistent and just install the application silently to the program files folder. If you used the scope local in the settings preferences above, then the installed application is placed in your user accounts AppData folder.\nTo upgrade an installed application to the latest version, run the upgrade option. As always, if unsure about the application name, use its ID instead.\nwinget upgrade PeaZip -h And finally one of my favorites, like the Linux command apt-get upgrade you can just run\nwinget upgrade --all -h To update all installed applications which can be found in the repository to their latest version. Because we also set the -h parameter, it\u0026rsquo;s done silently again.\nFinal words Here it is, a native package manager for Windows applications. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s version 1.0 and you can\u0026rsquo;t expect that you found your lovely package or get a fancy UI. But, for found applications, the repeated sessions to search, download and update are gone. Just run an upgrade --all from time to time (or automate it) and your are done.\nThis tool, saves you a lot of time. Have fun.\nPlease leave a comment if there is something wrong or missing.

But let me begin with some pros and cons about the Arch Linux distribution here.\nThe Arch Linux distribution describes itself as \u0026ldquo;a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple\u0026rdquo;\nThats it - Arch Linux is absolutely the right distribution for you, if you like a system, what only does, what you have installed and configured. It does it only that way, no magic happens. In addition it has a great community with a up-to-date wiki about nearly all aspects of the system. So if you have to configure a package, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly enough to follow the associated article there.\nWidely used distributions There is no need to dive in as deep as you have to with Slackware or Gentoo. For example, normally you don\u0026rsquo;t have to compile anything, but you have the freedom to do it anyways. Both are like Arch Linux a rolling releases. That means, you can have always the latest stable version of the kernel and all software packages, mostly on the same day of their release. Big pro for update junkies and you never have to do a big upgrade after a half year of waiting.\nOn the other hand, there are Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. They are working out of the box. They have a graphical installer, pre-configured packages and including proprietary drivers for e.g. graphic cards. Most Debian based distribution are not rolling released. They have big releases from time to time and you can choose to upgrade or stay with your release for a while. Updates are mostly security fixes only. If you a beginner or just want to use a good looking Linux, without have to worry about internals - choose them.\nRound-up In my opinion, Arch Linux catches the sweet spot. Without spending most of the time in configuring details, you get an always up-to-date, slim distribution. And while working with it, you have the chance to learn a lot about how the linux-ecosystem works.\nIn future posts, I will help you with some aspects here.\nPlease leave a comment if there is something wrong or missing. Or if you have any questions. Have fun!\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support my work, feel free to buy me a coffee! Your support helps me continue creating content. Thank you!
