## Intro

The BigTreeTech CB1 is a powerful Raspberry Pi alternative for 3D printing enthusiasts, but its stock software often lags behind. By installing Armbian - a lightweight, optimized Linux distribution - you'll gain access to newer packages, better hardware support, and streamlined updates. This guide not only modernizes your CB1 but also unlocks advanced features:

1. **CAN Bus Support**: Reduce wiring complexity for multi-tool printers
2. **TFT35 SPI Integration**: Proper touchscreen functionality
3. **NetworkManager**: Simplified Wi-Fi/Ethernet management
4. **Klipper Optimization**: Prepare for fluid printing operations

While focused on 3D printing, these techniques apply to any CB1/Manta M8P project.

## Install basic armbian image

### Preparation

1. Download:
   - [Armbian Bookworm Minimal](https://www.armbian.com/bigtreetech-cb1/) (IoT optimized)
   - [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (cross-platform flashing tool)

#### SD Card Installation

1. Insert â‰¥8GB SD card
2. Flash Armbian with Balena-Etcher

#### EMMC Installation

Some steps to replace the outdated BigTreeTech cb1 linux image with the current armbian linux and also enable network, canbus and your BigTreeTech TFT35 SPI.

[BTT Flash Documentation](https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1?tab=readme-ov-file#cb1-emmc-version)

- Download [sunxi-tools](https://github.com/bigtreetech/sunxi-tools)
- For windows also download driver installer [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)
- Download armbian Image [text](https://www.armbian.com/bigtreetech-cb1/). Suggest the current minimal/IOT version Bookworm Minimal

- Install driver
- Switch to external usb storage mode
- Flash armbian with balena etcher
- change dbo to emmc

### Configure NetworkManager

Replace restrictive netplan with user-friendly networking:

1. Connect via Ethernet:

   ```bash
   ssh root@bigtreetech-cb1 # Default password: 1234
   ```

2. Update system & install NetworkManager:

   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   apt install network-manager -y
   apt purge netplan.io -y
   rm -rf /etc/systemd/network/*
   ```

3. Connect to Wi-Fi

   ```bash

   nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "PASSWORD" ifname wlan0
   nmcli connection modify "SSID" connection.autoconnect yes
   ```

4. Prevent boot delays from network services:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
   sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
   ```

### Configure CAN Bus

Enable high-speed tool communication:

/etc/systemd/network/can0.link

_Seems like this file has currently no effect on some systems. There is a workaround with udev rules below._

```systemd
[Match]
Type=can

[Link]
TransmitQueueLength=128
```

1. Create /etc/systemd/network/can0.network

   ```systemd
   [Match]
   Name=can0

   [CAN]
   BitRate=1000000
   RestartSec=10s
   ```

2. Create /etc/systemd/network/can0.link
   _The link file has currently no effect, workaround with udev rules below_

   ```systemd
   [Match]

   Type=can

   [Link]
   TransmitQueueLength=128
   ```

   **Workaround** Add udev rule /etc/udev/rules.d/80-can.rules:

   ```sh
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="can*", ATTR{tx_queue_len}="128"
   ```

### TFT35 SPI Display Setup

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-tft35.conf

```xorg
Section "Device"
  Identifier      "FBDEV"
  Driver          ""
  Option          "fbdev" "/dev/fb0"
  Option          "SwapbuffersWait" "true"
EndSection
```

### Disable Reboot Watchdog

Edit `/etc/systemd/system.conf`

```systemd
RebootWatchdogSec=off
```

## Install Klipper Stack

Automated setup with KIAUH:

1. Download and install

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh.git
   cd kiauh && ./kiauh.sh
   ```

2. Recommended selections:

   - Klipper: Latest version
   - Moonraker: API server
   - Mainsail: Modern web interface
   - KlipperScreen: Touchscreen UI (Choose Wayland backend)

   1. Optional Add-ons:
      - Crowsnest: Camera streaming
      - Obico: Remote monitoring and KI failure detection
