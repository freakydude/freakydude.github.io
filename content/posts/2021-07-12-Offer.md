I have fun with DJing since years now, in my free time. I started 13 years ago, once a week in a student club. I did also a lot of weddings and private partys in the past years.

You love electronic dance music like house, deep-house or tech-house? You need a DJ for your party, event or wedding? You are ready for party escalation - or need just a chill-out atmosphere? Then [contact me](mailto:dj@freakydu.de), let us talk, what I could do for your event.

## Your expectation

I'm the right choice for you if you looking for
- House, Deep-House, Tech-House (my favorite genres)
- Dance
- Disco 80's, 90's
- Or even some Classic Rock, RnB or Aprés-Ski tracks

## Recordings

You can listen into some of streamed House recordings on my [Mixloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/freakydude/) profile.
